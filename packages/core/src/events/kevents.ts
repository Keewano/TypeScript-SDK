/**
 * Predefined event IDs sent on the wire.
 *
 * The numeric gaps (27, 31, 41, 44-49, 51-53, 55-56, 61-63, 68-70) are
 * preserved intentionally: they represent IDs that are not currently
 * assigned on the server, and widening them later would break wire
 * compatibility.
 *
 * A subset of IDs (`GENUINITY_CHECK`, `GPU_TYPE`, `VRAM_SIZE`,
 * `LOW_MEM_WARNING`) is present in the enum but is never emitted by
 * this SDK because React Native has no equivalent JS API to source the
 * data. They are kept here so future native modules or platform
 * adapters can fire them without ID conflicts.
 *
 * Each ID is serialized as a uint16 LE on the wire, immediately after
 * the event timestamp.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { KEvents } from '@keewano/core';
 *
 * KEvents.BUTTON_CLICK;        // 20
 * KEvents.APP_LAUNCH;          // 2
 * KEvents.AD_OFFERED_TYPE;     // 79
 * ```
